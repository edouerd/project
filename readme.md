##### Home Goods
###### Simple Home Goods.

1. [*Reference Points*](#7) — An ode to repitition, replication, object memory, hyperlinking, etc.
	- nⁿ Vessels — Vessels mirroring the volume of train rails. Cups, flower holders, etc.
		- [ ] measure the circumfrences of train rails
		- [ ] investigate which materials are available for rapid prototyping via Shapeways
		- [ ] design a set of vessels to be used together
		- [ ] design a simple cardboard packaging for 'em
	- Play Grounds — Remove the shell from the trains, leave the rails.
		- [ ] begin to overlay drawings in primary colors over photos of train interiors 
		- [ ] print out on large architectural paper, include orthographics
	- Clothes Rail — A particular form observed in certain trains makes for a good clothing rail.
	 	- [ ] measure the circumfrences of train rails
	 	- [ ] prototype a structure of this sort with cheaper material (PVC?)
	 	- [ ] design and spec something that could be manufactured easily out of a single rail
	- Grate Mats — Mats/Blankets taking on the form of metal grating throughout New York. Heavy wool.
		- [ ] source appropriate fabric (wool?)
		- [ ] do a crayon/characoal rub of a grate, scan into a computer
		- [ ] figure out how a softgood process would work
	- Tearaways — Fabric decorations that echo their namesake.
		- [ ] photograph examples throughout the city
		- [ ] collect a few samples of tearaways
		- [ ] prototyping a few examples by hand, potentially dye
	- Votive — A light-emitting object modeled after the classical Mexican votive candle.
	 	- [ ] measure the circumfrences of a typical votive candle
	 	- [ ] figure out what direction this one is going to take
	 	- [ ] design an enclosure for some electronics/sensors
 	- Crosswalk Bench — A small foyer-bench the same dimensions as a painted block in a crosswalk.
 		- [x] obtain measurements of one of the painted blocks
 		- [ ] model out a simple bench
 		- [ ] build bench!


2. *Structural Cat Toys* — Basically Really Great and Simple Cat Toys. Let’s start prototyping by ripping apart existing toys.
	- Steps to take
		- [ ] Rip apart pre-existing toys with bells, crinkly bits, etc. within.
		- [ ] Rough-prototyping shells with pre-existing components

3. *Sampler* — A website-creation tool that doesn’t require a computer. Samples the local environment to build webpages.
	- Steps to take
		- [ ] Figure out how to translate sensor inputs into abstract web elements
		- [ ] Prototype with some kind of miniature board computer + sensors
		- [ ] Design an enclosure, figure out the minification process

4. *Indexing* — Inside of my nyc apartment there was a newspaper or book cut into very thin strips and arranged tightly inside a wooden frame. I imagined the strips to be arranged into further smaller squares that could be removed.
	- Steps to take
		- [ ] Re-assess if this project makes any sense

5. *Waterfall Wi-fi* — A small fountain/waterfall which pours forth water as long as there is a wifi connection. "As the wi-fi gets weaker, the strong flow of water decreases…” Data Fountain  

6. *Måla Mount* — Drawing roll, mountable. Improve an IKEA object.  

7. *Cloth Clips* — 3D Printed Uniform clips that could be used to clamp pieces of cloth together, forming clothing. A means by which to open-source clothing design.  

8. *Watering* — When I was living in my parent's house, there would be certain days where we'd realize that there were a lot of cups lying about half-filled with water ( usually generated from myself ). When this happened, I'd be told to round up all of the cups and pour them into the cacti we had around the house, and that way the plants would be watered intermittently, which is perfectly fine for such hardy plants.

##### Interventions
###### Alt–reality–generation & activism projects.

1. Dream Studio — Photographs from around the world of fictional Mornings HQs
	- Steps to take
		- [ ] Continue to take photographs of nice storefronts around the world.
		- [ ] Edit these photos in clever ways
		- [ ] Display all edits on a website in some novel gallery format.
		- [ ] Bonus: Utilize a map view for the site (Mapbox maybe)

2. Death Cultures — A long term investigation into how death cultures will adapt to changing human networks.
	- Research
		- [ ] Read as many articles as possible on the subject, 
		- [ ] Tie in personal story of 
	- Prototyping
		- [ ] Networked Tomb
		- [ ] Network of the dead 

3. $19.95 — Infomercial Design and Research. (On hold)
4. Paper Prototyping Library — A digital library of methods of easy physical prototyping.
5. Archives — Redesign non-for-profit sites such as archive.org, gutenberg.org, various linux distros, etc.
6. Affordances — Extending further the ideas and practice of Jane Fulton Suri and Naoto Fukusawa, enact documentation of methods by which people extend their environment into working products.
7. Offerings — Extending further the ideas and practice of Jane Fulton Suri and Naoto Fukusawa, document objects which 'bend' or offer themselves to their users.

1. Affordances, Offerings — An anthology of two Interventions projects. A documentation of physical objects and envvironments that offer themselves up to humanity
2. Postmortem Portfolio — A print-oriented documentation of projects I’ve worked on that have failed.
3. Tic — Record on video the numerous tics associated with digital technology. Preferably close in shot with minimal context. Press a book displaying clothing and accessories meant to alleviate and/or aggravate tics that have been mentioned.
4. CULT FLYERS — An exploration into new–age propagandism and information dissemination.
5. Cybernetics Club Reader — A publication documenting the findings of CC, a learning group.

##### Worlds
###### Apps, virtual environments, and hyper-narratives

1. VR Moods — A virtual environment in which the viewer is reclining in a lawn chair in the middle of a hyper dynamic environment. The user can only observe, switch music, and switch the scenery.
